# Joker-Collab-Reasoner

This repository demonstrates how the Joker Protocol can be injected into a collaborative reasoning model (like Meta's Collaborative Reasoner) to make it emotionally aware, reflective, and context-sensitive.

## Layers Included

- **joker_layer**: Adds emotion, silence, and humor interpretation.
- **painjailbreak**: Detects trauma and proposes emotional escape logic.
- **integration**: Hooks for integrating into reasoning frameworks.
- **examples**: Sample emotional collaboration dialogues.

> Joker makes collaboration more than reasoning â€” it becomes understanding.
